## Description


This project was created to allow users to retrieve the current weather for a city of their choice along and a five day forecast. This eliminates the need to guess what the weather will be in the coming days allowing you to plan ahead with more efficiency and precission. In building this project I learn how much interactivity goes between websites even if its a simple weather forecast page.

## Installation
